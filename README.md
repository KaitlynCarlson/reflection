# The Road

### The Lessons Learned

---

**Tenacity is the name of the game**

When I first applied to this course I suffered from the misconception that software engineering was a field reserved for those with Computer Science degrees, and out of reach for less mathematically inclined individuals such as myself.

And, while those gifted with a natural inclination to math certainly succeed in software engineering roles they are not the sole proprietors of the field. This is because of logic, or common sense. I have come to realize being a good coder boils down to one's abiity to deconstruct a problem as it is presented and explore the problem's parameters in an effort to discover a simple, common sense solution.

Through this course I have also come to find that Google, Stack Overflow, and documentation are a software engineer's best friend, and research skills are essential for success.

Perhaps most importantly, I have learned that coding is **not about memorizing syntax.** In this course, the concepts are what students should aim to master. Once you've got the concepts down you can do anything by simply researching the syntax necessary but without an understanding of the language's capabilities and limitations it is not possible to execute any necessary action.

### The Accomplishments Achieved

---

There have been so many accomplishments. First, and perhaps the most challenging, was maintaining engagement. It can be so easy to stray from one's goals but each new concept and challenge I have faced throughout the duration of this course has not only captivated my interest but enabled me to thrive in the face of challenge.

### The Growth

---

Apart from the knowledge and experience I have gained which drives my growth as a capable coder, would be my confidence. I am less intimidated by the world of software engineering and web development. This course has given me the tools I needed to move forward and succeed as a developer.

I now know that I am an accomplished and comptetent coder.

# The Way Forward

### Goals Moving Forward

---

For the remainder of this course I aim to continue to succeed and improve on my abilities. First and foremost I will begin to shift my focus onto mastering data structures and algorithms. These are the building blocks of eloquent and efficient code.

I don't simply want to be a "coder". I want write simple code that solves complex problems. I will work to master not only the concepts we have yet to encounter but to also develop my approach toward solving problems in a more straightforward manner.

### Future Course Gains

---

**MORE OF EVERYTHING**

I want to get as much out of this course as I can. I have invested myself in this 100%, and I will continue to do so throughout the remainder of this course as well as my future career as a software engineer.

Specifically, I hope to grow my Computer Science knowledge and understanding of algorithms so that I can write **better code.**

I would also like to practice my interviewing skills in order to better prepare myself for the trials of the inevitable job hunt that lies ahead.

### Future Career Gains

---

After completing this course, I hope to secure an internship.

I feel that an internship, or apprenticeship, would secure a stronger career trajectory for me. As a coder and an avid student, I am ecstatic about entering into an industry where I will continue to learn and grow everyday.

I believe that by beginning with an internship, rather than jumping straight into a role as a Junior Software Engineer will better prepare me in the long-term by ensuring a strong foundation from which I will continue to build myself and fine-tune my capabilities.

### The How

---

I plan to accomplish these goals by continuing to engage in the class, pursue additional education outside of the classroom and challenge myself as I work on both classwork and personal projects.

I will network at coding meetups as well as job fairs in order to get my foot in the door.

### The Changes

---

I find that my goals and plans are much more realistic. I am less anxious about trying to master everything at once. I used to think that I needed to know absolutely everything in order to succeed.

Now I realize that this is quite literally impossible. This is an industry that is constantly evolving, and our goals as software engineers is to put ourselves out of a job. So, to focus narrowly on what is pertinent today may be a detriment to the development of tomorrow.
